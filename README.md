# EnderpearlData
Calculates maximum distance ender pearl can be thrown as a function of height. It is common for people to believe that the optimal pitch to throw pearls is 45 degrees on flat ground, but the results of this show that it is between 38 and 39 degrees. As the height of the platform you are throwing towards decreases, the optimal pitch decreases. 

The chart below shows that the data can be approximated quite well by a logartihmic function.
